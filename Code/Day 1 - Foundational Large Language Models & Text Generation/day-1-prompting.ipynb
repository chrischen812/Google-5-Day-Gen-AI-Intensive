He met a sleek Siamese named Luna, who had stories of daring escapes and epic battles with neighborhood dogs. He learned to navigate the alleyways, decipher the unspoken language of cats, and even discovered a hidden stash of delicious tuna scraps.\n","\n","Days turned into weeks, and Bartholomew, though missing his family, felt a newfound sense of freedom.

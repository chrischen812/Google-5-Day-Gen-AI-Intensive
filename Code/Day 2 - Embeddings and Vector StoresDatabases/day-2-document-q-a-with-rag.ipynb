A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n","\n","1. Indexing\n","2. Retrieval\n","3. Generation\n","\n","Indexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n","\n","In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.\n","\n","## For help\n","\n","**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"akuOzK4dJl3j"},"source":["## Setup\n","\n","First, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-12T18:33:31.145634Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-12T18:33:31.144589Z"},"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP","trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution - (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n","WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -ensorboard (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n","WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -ensorflow-intel (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n","WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution - (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n","WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -ensorboard (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n","WARNING: Ignoring invalid distribution -ensorflow-intel (c:\\users\\chris\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages)\n"]}],"source":["%pip install -U -q \"google-generativeai>=0.8.3\" chromadb"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["You may see output containing `ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed` - this is OK, the packages are still installed and compatible for this codelab."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"muuhsDmmKdHi","trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["import google.generativeai as genai\n","from IPython.display import Markdown"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FQOGMejVu-6D"},"source":["### Set up your API key\n","\n","To run the following cell, your API key must be stored it in a [Kaggle secret](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/114053) named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.\n","\n","If you don't already have an API key, you can grab one from [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

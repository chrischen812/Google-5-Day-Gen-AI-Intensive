You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

The sunbeams in his usual spot by the window were becoming monotonous, the tuna in his bowl, predictable. He yearned for excitement, for the unknown, for something...more. Then, he saw it. A tiny, trembling moth, fluttering against the windowpane.\n\nThis wasn't just any moth. This moth was a symphony of emerald and gold, a miniature masterpiece of nature. Bartholomew, usually dismissive of the buzzing insects, felt a pang of empathy for the creature's struggle. He gently pushed open the window, and the moth, startled, shot into the garden. \n\nBartholomew, seized by an unexpected urge, followed. The garden, usually a familiar playground of fragrant herbs and sun-dappled flowers, was now an uncharted wilderness. He stalked through the tall grass, his whiskers twitching with anticipation. He chased after the moth, its tiny wings a blur of color against the lush green foliage.\n\nTheir adventure led them through a maze of rose bushes, past a slumbering hedgehog, and into a forgotten corner of the garden, where a miniature, dilapidated treehouse stood. Bartholomew, usually disdainful of heights, scrambled up the rickety ladder, his claws finding purchase on the rough wood. The moth, perched on a gnarled branch, seemed to be beckoning him further.\n\nInside, the treehouse was a wonderland of dust motes and forgotten trinkets. Bartholomew, his curiosity piqued, explored with a newfound fervor. He sniffed at a chipped teacup, batted at a cobwebbed swing, and chased a stray beam of sunlight through the dusty window.\n\nAs the sun began to set, casting long shadows across the garden, Bartholomew realized he was lost. He looked around, panic rising in his chest. The garden, once familiar, now seemed vast and daunting. He missed the comfort of his windowsill, the warmth of his human's lap. \n\nJust then, he heard a familiar voice calling his name. His human, concerned by his absence, had come searching. With relief, Bartholomew leaped down from the treehouse and raced towards the sound of her voice.\n\nHe returned home, exhausted but exhilarated. The garden, once ordinary, was now a tapestry of adventures. He snuggled into his human's lap, a content purr rumbling in his chest. The moth, perched on the windowsill, seemed to be watching him with a knowing glint in its eyes. Bartholomew knew he would never forget his adventure, a secret shared only with a tiny, emerald-and-gold moth. He had found something more than just excitement – he had found a sense of wonder, a reminder that even the most ordinary life can hold extraordinary moments. And, for Bartholomew, that was enough. \n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Prompting\n\nThis section contains some prompts from the chapter for you to try out directly in the API.

It leverages Git information and enhances your command-line experience by displaying the branch, status, remote changes, and more directly in your prompt. \n\nHere's a breakdown of why you might use it:\n\n* **Enhanced Git Awareness:**  The script integrates seamlessly with Git, displaying your current branch, whether there are uncommitted changes, tracking status, and more. This helps you stay informed about your Git repository without needing to run separate `git` commands.\n* **Customizable Prompt:**  You can tailor the prompt's appearance with various color schemes, symbols, and formatting options. It includes built-in themes (like \"Default\" and \"Custom\") and even allows you to create your own.\n* **Virtual Environment Integration:**  The script detects and displays your active virtual environment (if using `virtualenv`, `conda`, or `nvm`), so you're always aware of your current development context.\n* **Prompt Logic and Control:**  It provides functions to reset the prompt, update the state based on command execution status, and even toggle the display of the Git information. \n* **Remote Status Checking:**  The script can automatically fetch remote changes if your local branch is outdated, keeping you informed about changes on the server.\n* **Cross-Shell Compatibility:**  It's designed to work with both bash and zsh, ensuring a consistent experience across different shells.\n\n**In essence, this script helps you work with Git and your development environment more efficiently by providing a visually informative and customizable command-line prompt.**\n\nTo use it, you would typically source it within your shell's configuration file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) and then optionally adjust any settings to customize its behavior and appearance. \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
